# Hanif.studio – Positioning, SEO, and Conversion Update Plan

This document summarizes the recommended changes to better align the landing page, SEO, and messaging with Hanif’s real USP:
**solo AI-first product engineer, faster than agencies, founder-focused.**

---

## 1. Core Positioning (North Star)

**Current perception:**
- Generic “full-stack product engineer”
- Competing in a crowded SEO field (MVP dev, SaaS dev, full-stack dev)

**New positioning:**
> AI-first solo product engineer helping founders ship MVPs 3–5× faster than agencies.

**Key pillars:**
- Solo (no agency layers)
- AI-first workflows
- Faster delivery
- Direct founder communication
- End-to-end execution

---

## 2. Hero Section Rewrite (Above the Fold)

### Replace current hero headline with:

**Option A (Primary recommendation):**
> **AI-First Product Engineer for Founders — Launch MVPs 3× Faster Than Agencies**

**Subheadline:**
> I build startups’ core apps end-to-end using AI workflows and direct collaboration — no agency noise, no middlemen.

**Supporting bullets (optional under hero):**
- Solo dev, direct communication
- Faster than agencies, cheaper than hiring
- Next.js + AI + clean architecture

---

## 3. Meta Tags Update (SEO + Conversion)

### Replace existing meta tags with:

```html
<title>Hanif — AI-First Product Engineer for Founders | Faster MVP Delivery</title>
<meta name="title" content="Hanif — AI-First Product Engineer for Founders | Faster MVP Delivery" />
<meta name="description" content="Build and launch your MVP 3× faster than agencies with a solo AI-first product engineer. Direct collab, transparent pricing, end-to-end execution — from idea to live product." />

<!-- Open Graph -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.hanif.studio/" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Hanif — AI-First Product Engineer for Founders | Faster MVP Delivery" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Build and launch your MVP 3× faster than agencies with a solo AI-first product engineer. Direct collab, transparent pricing, end-to-end execution — from idea to live product." />

<!-- X (Twitter) -->
<meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta property="twitter:url" content="https://www.hanif.studio/" />
<meta property="twitter:title" content="Hanif — AI-First Product Engineer for Founders | Faster MVP Delivery" />
<meta property="twitter:description" content="Build and launch your MVP 3× faster than agencies with a solo AI-first product engineer. Direct collab, transparent pricing, end-to-end execution — from idea to live product." />
```

## 4. Section Copy Tweaks

### “Why Me?” Section – Rewrite Angle

**Goal:** Emphasize speed + solo advantage vs agencies

**Suggested bullets:**
- Solo product engineer — no layers, no handoffs
- AI-first workflows for faster iteration
- Direct founder communication
- Fixed timelines, transparent scope
- Ship in weeks, not months

---

### Services Section – Reframe

**Before (generic):**
- Web apps, mobile apps, integrations

**After (outcome-focused):**
- MVP builds for startups
- AI SaaS development
- Internal tools & dashboards
- API integrations & automations
- Chrome extensions for growth

---

## 5. A/B Test Hero Variants (Optional)

**Variant A (Founder-first):**
> Launch Your AI MVP 3× Faster — Without Agencies

**Variant B (Outcome-first):**
> From Idea to Live in Weeks — Fast MVP with AI-Powered Dev

**Metric to track:**
- Hero CTA click-through rate
- Contact form submissions
- Time on page

---

## 6. SEO Strategy (Non-Generic Keywords)

Avoid targeting:
- full stack developer
- MVP developer
- SaaS developer

Target long-tail positioning keywords instead:
- solo AI product engineer
- build MVP faster than agency
- AI SaaS MVP developer
- Next.js AI startup developer
- fractional CTO for AI startups

---

## 7. Future Landing Page Idea (Optional)

**Dedicated USP landing page headline:**
> Ship Your AI MVP 3× Faster — Without Agencies

**Sub:**
> Solo product engineer. Direct communication. Fixed timeline.

**CTA:**
> Book a 15-min Founder Call

---
